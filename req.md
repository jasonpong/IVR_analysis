# IVR Automated Call Detection System Requirements

## Executive Summary

This document outlines business requirements for a three-stage approach to detecting and preventing automated bot interactions in our IVR system. The phased approach progresses from historical analysis to real-time intervention, allowing the organization to build capabilities incrementally while managing risk and resource allocation.

## Requirements by Stage

| Category | Stage 1: Analytical Detection | Stage 2: Near Real-Time Detection | Stage 3: Real-Time Intervention |
|----------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Primary Objective** | Establish baseline metrics and patterns of automated bot activity to quantify scope of the problem | Detect bot activity during or immediately after IVR interaction to enable rapid response | Automatically detect and interdict bot interactions in real-time with authentication challenges |
| **Detection Timing** | Post-call analysis (historical/batch processing) | Within 5 seconds of call completion | During active call (within 3 seconds of suspicious pattern) |
| **Data Collection** | Capture DTMF pulse characteristics (timing, duration, inter-digit intervals); Retain data for minimum 90 days; Collect metadata: call source, time, ANI, account, IVR path | All Stage 1 capabilities; Real-time streaming of call data; Enhanced metadata capture for investigation | All Stage 2 capabilities; In-session behavioral tracking; Cross-channel signal correlation |
| **Detection Methods** | DTMF timing pattern analysis (variance less than 50ms); Rapid navigation detection; Account targeting patterns; Bot confidence scoring (0-100%) | All Stage 1 capabilities; Machine learning models from historical data; Basic audio analysis (synthesized voice, background noise anomalies); Adaptive threshold adjustment | All Stage 2 capabilities; Advanced audio analysis (voice biometrics, speech synthesis detection, environmental audio); External threat intelligence integration; Cross-channel correlation |
| **Response Actions** | Generate reports and dashboards; Flag accounts for investigation; No real-time intervention | Generate immediate alerts (bot score greater than 75%); Automatic account flagging; Enable temporary access restrictions; Create fraud investigation cases | Interrupt IVR flow (bot score greater than 85%); Initiate OTP challenge workflow; Maintain call session during authentication; Resume or terminate based on auth result |
| **Alerting and Notification** | Monthly executive summary reports; Ad-hoc query capabilities; Historical trend dashboards | Real-time alerts to fraud teams; Multiple channels (email, SMS, dashboard, ticketing); Alert routing based on severity and account type; Detailed alert content with recommended actions | In-call customer messaging; Multi-channel OTP delivery (SMS, email, push); Real-time operational dashboards; Customer escalation pathways |
| **Authentication** | Not applicable | Not applicable | Generate 6-digit OTP (5-min expiry); Multi-channel delivery (SMS/email/push); 3 entry attempts allowed; 2 resend options; Alternate auth methods (agent transfer) |
| **Customer Experience** | No customer impact | Minimal customer impact (post-call alerts may trigger outreach) | Clear, non-alarming security messaging; 60-second completion target; Challenge rate limiting (max 1/24hrs for borderline cases); Immediate agent escalation option; Graceful handling of false positives |
| **Reporting and Analytics** | Daily/weekly/monthly bot volume trends; Percentage of total IVR traffic from bots; Targeted account segments; Peak activity times/days; Geographic distribution; Financial impact assessment | All Stage 1 capabilities; Mean time to detection (MTTD) metrics; Mean time to response (MTTR) metrics; False positive rate tracking; Alert acknowledgment and resolution tracking | All Stage 2 capabilities; OTP success/failure rates; Intervention outcome tracking; Customer abandonment analysis; A/B testing results; Model performance feedback loops |
| **Performance Requirements** | Process 100% of call volume in batch; No latency requirements | 99.5% uptime during business hours; Maximum 10-second latency during peak; Concurrent call processing | 99.9% availability; Sub-3-second detection and intervention; Support 10,000+ concurrent challenged sessions |
| **Integration Points** | IVR platform (read-only data access); Data warehouse/analytics platform; Reporting tools | All Stage 1 integrations; Fraud case management system; CRM for account flagging; Alert notification platforms | All Stage 2 integrations; OTP delivery services (SMS gateway, email, push); Voice biometric systems; External threat intelligence feeds |
| **Success Metrics** | 85%+ detection accuracy (precision); Quantified bot traffic baseline; Financial impact documented; Business case validated | 90%+ detection accuracy; Less than 5% false positive rate; Mean time to detection less than 5 minutes; 40-60% fraud loss reduction | 80%+ bot blocking rate; Less than 5% false positive rate; Less than 3 second intervention latency; Less than 2% customer satisfaction impact; 80-90% fraud loss reduction |
| **Business Outcomes** | Quantify scope and financial impact; Identify high-risk segments; Build investment business case; Establish detection benchmarks | Reduce vulnerability window to minutes; Enable proactive customer protection; Build operational response capability; Demonstrate measurable fraud reduction | Real-time fraud prevention; Industry-leading bot detection; Minimal customer friction; Maximum ROI through loss prevention |
| **Team Requirements** | Fraud analytics team for report review; Data engineering for pipeline setup; Executive stakeholders for insights | All Stage 1 teams; 24/7 fraud operations for alert response; Customer service for follow-up; Target: Less than 15 min alert response time | All Stage 2 teams; OTP delivery infrastructure support; Enhanced customer service training; Real-time monitoring and incident response |

## Cross-Stage Requirements

### Data Privacy and Compliance
- All stages shall comply with applicable regulations (TCPA, GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
- System shall obtain and respect consent for call recording and analysis where required
- System shall implement data retention policies aligned with legal and business requirements
- System shall provide audit trails for all automated decisions affecting customer access

### Integration Architecture
- System shall integrate with existing IVR platform with minimal disruption
- System shall support standard APIs for future extensibility
- System shall maintain backward compatibility as capabilities evolve across stages

### Scalability and Performance
- System shall scale to handle 100% of IVR call volume across all stages
- System shall maintain performance during traffic spikes (3x normal volume)
- System shall process historical analysis (Stage 1) without impacting real-time performance (Stages 2-3)
