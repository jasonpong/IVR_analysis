## Geolocation Approach Comparison

Aspect	ThreatMetrix HTML5 Geolocation	Fingerprint IP Geolocation
Precision	GPS-level (meters)	City-level (5-50km radius)
User Consent	Required - explicit permission prompt	Not required - passive
Consent Rates	Low (industry-wide problem)	N/A - no prompt needed
User Friction	High - permission dialog	None - transparent
Accuracy Indicator	GPS precision	Radius in kilometers
Privacy	Exact location	Generalized to public areas
Use Case Fit	High precision needed	Balance of accuracy & UX

Key Insight: ThreatMetrix can provide meter-level accuracy but requires user permission, which has low acceptance rates industry-wide. Fingerprint provides city-level accuracy (with km radius confidence) without any user consent requirement, creating zero friction while still enabling effective fraud detection and location verification.
